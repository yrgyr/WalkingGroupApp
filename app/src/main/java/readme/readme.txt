Part I
					***Edit user's own information***

* User can edit his/her own information by logging in using their email and corresponding password. The edit info option can be found on the top right
  corner of the screen.
   
* User can change their email id if their new email id does not exist in the server. If user's changed email id  
  already exist in the server, an error message will be displayed on the screen and the email id will not be updated.

* The updated information can be sent to the server by clicking the 'validate' button on the screen.

* Every time the edit info activity is opened it will show all the previously stored field and if that field is not updated
  by the user then same data will be sent to the server.


				***Edit child's information as a parent***

* A parent can edit any user's information that is in their monitored list.

* In the parent's monitor list if the parent clicks on any user, a new screen will be shown containing files to edit the monitored user's information.


Part II
          In a view groups activity, we can select a group and then it will show a group member list. If you are a leader of this group, members of this group or members’ parents of the group, you can click on member on the list and then it will show a list of the member’s parents which you click. Now you can click on their parent to get the future information. If you are not one of the three roles I mentioned before, you can not access children’ parents’ information. It can help to protect the personal information.

Part III
         ***Uploading GPS location***

- Start/stop uploading location:
To upload the GPS location to your parents, you must first select a group you're currently walking with. In the home page, select View Groups to view all groups
close to your location. Click on the info window of the group to go to group management screen. From the action bar in the top right corner, select "Start walking with this group",
go back to the maps, and click on the "Start Uploading" button. The app will upload your current location to your parents every 30 seconds. You can stop the uploading
any time by pressing the "Stop uploading" button. You can navigate to any other pages of the app and the location upload will still continue, but closing the app will
stop the location upload. 

- When you reach your destination:
If your current location is detected to be within a 200 meters radius of the destination coordinates of the group you're walking with, it's assumed that you've reached
school and a 10 minutes countdown will start. If you stayed within this 200 meters radius for the entire duration of this timer, location upload will automatically stop
when 10 minutes is reached. If however you walked out of this 200 meters radius, the timer will reset and will restart as soon as walked back into this 200 meters radius.

***Parent's DashBoard***

- Viewing locations of your children and group leaders:
You can view the real-time GPS locations of your children and the leaders of all groups that your children are a member of. Locations are displayed as markers on the map
with 4 different colours depending on the user identities and how much time has elapsed since the last update:

1. Green: your children; GPS location last updated within the past 5 minutes.
2. Red: your children; GPS location last updated more than 5 minutes ago. 
3. Cyan: group leaders; GPS location last updated within the past 5 minutes.
4. Orange: group leaders; GPS location last updated more than 5 minutes ago.

Clicking on each marker brings up an info window showing the user name and time elapsed since their last location update.
Also, the user can manually click on the refresh button to update the location and unread messages count.

- New messages notification:
The app checks for new unread messages every minute, and a new messages icon will appear if you receive new messages. Clicking on the icon will allow you to
view the messages.  





Part IV
In the main activity and parents’ dashboard, we can click the mail icon to open the mailbox. In  the mailbox, Bold means unread and unbold means read. Emergent message will has a background color to highlight the message.
For the sending message, the leader can open the “VIEW GROUPS” activity and open the group he lead, he can see the button to send the message to all members in the group and their parents. In the sending page, he can choose the information emergent or not.
The panic button is inside the main activity. When the children click the button, it will open the send message page and automatically fill the text.  This button only allow children to use it. The parent or leader try to use this, the app will show to toast message to warn the user.
Children can send the non-emergent message to their parents and leaders inside the “VIEW GROUPS” page. Children clicks the group they inside and now it show the button in the bottom.
